# ProceduralDungeon


Small module for procedural dungeon generation :)

Simply require the module , initialise it and then start it !

You can give the module now a lot of settings to customize
the dungeon a lot more :)

Also you can get the state of the dungeon and the data
if it is finished :)

There is also an example included here ... not 100% sure if it still works have to check
